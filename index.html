      Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content,
      including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the
      simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.
      <br>

      The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. But
      it was not until 2014, with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine
      learning algorithm -- that generative AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real
      people.
      <br>

      On the one hand, this newfound capability has opened up opportunities that include better movie dubbing and rich
      educational content. It also unlocked concerns about deepfakes -- digitally forged images or videos -- and
      harmful cybersecurity attacks on businesses, including nefarious requests that realistically mimic an employee's
      boss.
      <br>

      Two additional recent advances that will be discussed in more detail below have played a critical part in
      generative AI going mainstream: transformers and the breakthrough language models they enabled. Transformers are
      a type of machine learning that made it possible for researchers to train ever-larger models without having to
      label all of the data in advance. New models could thus be trained on billions of pages of text, resulting in
      answers with more depth. In addition, transformers unlocked a new notion called attention that enabled models to
      track the connections between words across pages, chapters and books rather than just in individual sentences.
      And not just words: Transformers could also use their ability to track connections to analyze code, proteins,
      chemicals and DNA.
      <br>

      The rapid advances in so-called large language models (LLMs) -- i.e., models with billions or even trillions of
      parameters -- have opened a new era in which generative AI models can write engaging text, paint photorealistic
      images and even create somewhat entertaining sitcoms on the fly. Moreover, innovations in multimodal AI enable
      teams to generate content across multiple types of media, including text, graphics and video. This is the basis
      for tools like Dall-E that automatically create images from a text description or generate text captions from
      images.
      <br>

      These breakthroughs notwithstanding, we are still in the early days of using generative AI to create readable
      text and photorealistic stylized graphics. Early implementations have had issues with accuracy and bias, as well
      as being prone to hallucinations and spitting back weird answers. Still, progress thus far indicates that the
      inherent capabilities of this generative AI could fundamentally change enterprise technology how businesses
      operate. Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign
      business processes and transform supply chains.

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Generative AI will continue to evolve, making advancements in translation, drug
        discovery, anomaly detection and the generation of new content, from text and video to fashion design and music.
        As good as these new one-off tools are, the most significant impact of generative AI in the future will come
        from integrating these capabilities directly into the tools we already use.</p>
